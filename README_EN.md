# Telethon Userbot Adapter

A Telegram Userbot adapter for AstrBot built on top of Telethon.

> Important: use this plugin together with AstrBot's session whitelist. Without a whitelist, the adapter may reply to other bots and create message loops.

中文说明: [README.md](README.md)

## Features

- Receive Telegram messages with a user account and send text or image messages back
- Connect through a real Telegram user account, so uploads are not limited by the Bot API 50 MB upload cap
- Automatically split long messages to fit Telegram limits
- Support quoted replies via the `Reply` segment
- Provide `tg profile` to inspect user/group/channel profiles
- Provide `tg status` to inspect current AstrBot runtime status
- Provide `tg sticker` to add a replied image or sticker into your own sticker pack
- Provide `tg prune` / `tg selfprune` / `tg youprune` for batch message deletion
- Support `zh-CN` / `en-US` runtime responses and WebUI configuration text

## Notes

- This is a Userbot solution. Account restrictions or bans are governed by Telegram policy and are your own responsibility.
- `session_string` grants full access to the Telegram account. Store it carefully.
- If `session_string` expires, generate a new one and update the configuration.
- `telethon_userbot` does not support platform-level streaming display. If AstrBot enables `provider_settings.streaming_response`, set unsupported platforms to "disable streaming response" instead of "real-time segmented reply".
- The runtime platform type and plugin metadata in this repository are unified as `telethon_userbot`. Until AstrBot upstream merges the corresponding platform type, existing Telegram-specific hooks such as `@platform_adapter_type("telegram")`, `platform_specific.telegram.*`, and semantics based on `support_platforms` will not automatically target this adapter.
- Batch deletion is a high-risk operation. The current implementation keeps conservative limits enabled by default: each `prune` command deletes at most `200` messages at a time; `selfprune` / `youprune` scan at most `1000` recent messages; throttling is applied between each batch of `100` deletions.
- Delete permissions, service message constraints, and `FloodWait` behavior are determined by Telegram and Telethon. Even with correct parameters, deletion may partially succeed or fail because of permissions or rate limits.

## Installation

Place the plugin directory under `AstrBot`'s `data/plugins/` directory:

```text
data/plugins/astrbot_plugin_telethon_adapter/
```

After installation, AstrBot will install dependencies from `requirements.txt` automatically.

The dependency list includes `cryptg` to improve Telethon cryptography performance.

- On common glibc-based distributions, the prebuilt wheel usually installs directly.
- On Alpine Linux and other musl-based distributions, local build tooling is required, including at least `python3-dev`, `musl-dev`, `gcc`, `linux-headers`, `rust`, and `cargo`.

## Generate `session_string`

First, apply for `api_id` and `api_hash` at [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org). If the application page is unavailable, try another egress IP.

`session_string` must be generated through an interactive login flow. Run this under AstrBot's `data/plugins/` directory:

```bash
python3 ./astrbot_plugin_telethon_adapter/scripts/generate_session.py
```

The script will prompt for:

- `api_id`
- `api_hash`
- phone number

Then Telegram will send a login code, and the script will continue asking for:

- Telegram login code
- 2FA password, if enabled
- proxy settings, optional; supports `socks5`, `socks4`, `http`, and `mtproto`

The script prints a `StringSession` at the end. Copy it into AstrBot's `session_string` field.

Note: Telegram often sends the login code to an already logged-in Telegram client session instead of SMS.

## AstrBot Adapter Configuration

Add a new platform adapter in AstrBot and choose `telethon_userbot`, then fill in:

- `api_id`: Telegram API ID as an integer
- `api_hash`: Telegram API Hash
- `session_string`: the generated StringSession
- `language`: adapter instance language, supports `zh-CN` and `en-US`, default `zh-CN`
- `trigger_prefix`: trigger prefix, default `-astr`. This acts as the message entry filter prefix to reduce unrelated logs and downstream AstrBot pipeline calls; in this plugin it can replace a wake word
- `reply_to_self_triggers_command`: whether replying to your own message should trigger command handling, default `false`. Group chats only; when enabled, replying to a message sent by the current Telethon account is also treated as a wake-up trigger
- `download_incoming_media`: whether to download received media, recommended `true`
- `telethon_media_group_timeout`: debounce delay for media group aggregation in seconds, default `1.2`
- `telethon_media_group_max_wait`: maximum wait time for media group aggregation in seconds, default `8.0`
- `proxy_type`: proxy type, supports `socks5`, `socks4`, `http`, `mtproto`
- `proxy_host`: proxy server address
- `proxy_port`: proxy server port
- `proxy_username`: optional username for SOCKS or HTTP proxy
- `proxy_password`: optional password for SOCKS or HTTP proxy
- `proxy_secret`: required only for `mtproto` proxy

`language` affects:

- runtime command text such as `tg profile`, `tg status`, `tg sticker`, and `tg prune`

## Extra Commands

`tg profile` usage:

```text
-astr tg profile
-astr tg profile @username
-astr tg profile https://t.me/channel_name
```

Resolution order for `tg profile` targets:

- explicit argument: `@username`, numeric ID, `t.me` / `telegram.me` link, or `me`
- replied message: inspect the sender of the replied message
- current private chat peer
- current group or channel

`tg status` usage:

```text
-astr tg status
```

`tg status` returns:

- host platform
- Python / AstrBot / Telethon / plugin versions
- current Telegram data center
- current adapter ID
- system CPU / memory / swap usage
- current AstrBot process CPU / memory usage
- current process uptime

`tg sticker` usage:

```text
-astr tg sticker my_pack_name
-astr tg sticker
-astr tg sticker 😎
-astr tg sticker my_pack_name 😎
```

`tg sticker` behavior:

- without replying: `tg sticker <pack_name>` sets the default sticker pack name for the current account
- when replying to an image or sticker: `tg sticker` adds that media to the default sticker pack
- when replying with one argument that is not a valid pack name, the argument is treated as a custom emoji, for example `tg sticker 😎`
- when replying with two arguments, use `tg sticker <pack_name> <emoji>` to temporarily target a specific pack and emoji
- regular images are auto-scaled so the longest edge is `512px`, then converted to `webp`
- the default sticker pack name is stored in AstrBot's plugin KV storage and separated by adapter ID for multiple adapter instances

Batch deletion commands:

```text
-astr tg prune 20
-astr tg prune
-astr tg selfprune 20
-astr tg selfprune
-astr tg youprune @username 20
-astr tg youprune 20
```

Batch deletion details:

- `tg prune [count]`: delete recent messages in the current chat; when used as a reply, the count can be omitted and the command deletes messages between the reply anchor and the command; maximum `200` messages per run
- `tg selfprune [count]`: delete only your own messages; reply-anchor mode is supported; scans at most `1000` recent messages
- `tg youprune [target] [count]`: delete only messages from the target user; target supports `@username`, `t.me` links, or replying to a target message; scans at most `1000` recent messages
- `tg prune`, `tg selfprune`, and `tg youprune` all require the command message to reply to another message when the count is omitted
- deleting service messages, deleting other users' messages without permission, or hitting `FloodWait` may result in partial deletion
